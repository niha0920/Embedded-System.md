# Introduction to Embedded Systems
## Definition 
Dedicated computer designed to perform one or a few specific tasks - reliably and efficiently.
- It's usually tiny, highly optimized, and hidden inside another device.
- Always working behind the scenes.
## Characteristics of Embedded Systems 
key characteristics
- Dedicated function
- Work in real time
- Limited resources
- Low power consumption
## Embedded Systems vs General Computers
- PC is designed to run many applicatons - games, browsers, video editing.
- An embedded system is built to do just one job - but do it very efficiently.
## Real-World examples of Embedded Systems
Here are some real world examples
- Fitness band
- Washing machine
- Fuel, airbags, braking systems in cars
- Infusion pumps, heart monitors, ventilators in hospitals
## Embedded System in IoT
IoT is all about connecting devices to the internet - and embedded systems make it possible.
### A small irrigation system in agriculture uses:
- Sensors to check soil moisture
- A microcontroller to process data
- Wi-Fi to send info to the cloud
- And actuators to control water flow
